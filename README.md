# Problem Description: 
Our project focuses on creating a database for an online bookstore to efficiently track key business operations, including sales, employee hours, genres, authors, and inventory management. The database is designed to manage book inventory by categorizing books under a one-to-many relationship, where multiple ISBNs can belong to a single category. Sales transactions are recorded through a many-to-many relationship between books and sales, using a weak entity that links sales details with inventory. This structure allows for tracking which books are sold in each transaction. Additionally, employee work hours are managed through another many-to-many relationship between employees and shifts, where each employee can work multiple shifts, and each shift can have multiple employees. By structuring the database in this way, the system provides an organized method for analyzing book sales, tracking employee work schedules, and ensuring efficient inventory management.
